# My World of Text Client

https://web.myworldoftext.com

A hobby-based, self-hosted recreation of [FP/system2k's NodeWorldOfText](https://github.com/system2k/NodeWorldOfText).  
It provides an infinitely large collaborative text canvas where anyone can write anywhere, at any time. This client allows for experimentation and additional features not present in the original OWOT/YWOT.

## Additional Client Features
1. Menu options to control what is copied with Ctrl+C: choose to copy text color, cell color, and/or text decorations.
